**Your AI agent can't generate images. It has no real-time X data. It stops when rate limited.**

BlockRun fixes this with a wallet.

## The Problem

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Antigravity) are powerful, but they have hard limits:

```
Without BlockRun:              With BlockRun:
────────────────               ─────────────
❌ No image generation         ✅ DALL-E, Nano Banana
❌ No real-time X/Twitter      ✅ Grok has live X access
❌ Rate limits = work stops    ✅ Overflow to DeepSeek
❌ Single perspective          ✅ GPT second opinions
❌ 5 API keys to manage        ✅ One wallet, all models
```

**BlockRun extends your AI agent with capabilities it doesn't have.**

---

## Philosophy

> **Give your AI agent a wallet. Let it pay for its own superpowers.**

Your AI agent is brilliant — but limited. BlockRun removes those limits.

With BlockRun, your AI agent has its own wallet. When it needs a capability it doesn't have, it pays for it — autonomously.

| Need | Solution | Agent Pays |
|------|----------|------------|
| Generate an image | Calls DALL-E | $0.05 |
| Real-time X data | Calls Grok | $0.002 |
| Second opinion | Calls GPT-5.2 | $0.001 |
| Cheaper processing | Calls DeepSeek | $0.0001 |

No API keys. No human in the loop. Just an agent with a budget, acquiring capabilities on demand.

We don't replace your AI agent. We give it a wallet and let it buy what it needs.

**Today:** Images, real-time data, LLM routing.
**Tomorrow:** Video generation, music creation, and every capability your agent can't do natively.

---

## Who Is This For?

**This is for people who believe AI agents should have their own wallets.**

You fund the agent with $1-5 USDC. The agent pays for GPT, Grok, DALL-E autonomously. No API keys. No human approval needed for each call.

## Install

### Quick Install (One Command)

Auto-detects Claude Code or Antigravity and installs everything:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-agent-wallet/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Install

**Step 1: Install the Python SDK**
```bash
pip install blockrun-llm
```

**Step 2: Install the skill for your platform**

**Claude Code (Option A - Plugin Marketplace):**
```
/plugin marketplace add BlockRunAI/blockrun-agent-wallet
/plugin install blockrun
```

**Claude Code (Option B - Git Clone):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-agent-wallet ~/.claude/skills/blockrun
```

**Antigravity (global):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-agent-wallet ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/blockrun
```

### Verify

```bash
python3 -c "from blockrun_llm import status; status()"
```

You should see your wallet address and balance. A wallet is auto-created at `~/.blockrun/` on first use.

### Update

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockRunAI/blockrun-agent-wallet/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Usage

Just tell your agent:

```
"blockrun generate an image of a sunset"        → DALL-E creates it
"blockrun grok what's trending on X"            → Grok answers with live data
"blockrun GPT review this code"                 → AI reviewing AI
"blockrun deepseek summarize this file"         → DeepSeek saves 90%
```

Or ask for something your agent can't do — it will suggest BlockRun:

```
User: "generate a logo for my startup"
Agent: "I can't generate images. Want me to route to DALL-E via BlockRun?"
User: "yes"
→ Done
```

## What You Get

| Capability | Count | Examples |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **AI Models** | 30+ | GPT-5, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, o3 |
| **Providers** | 5 | OpenAI, xAI, Google, DeepSeek, Anthropic |
| **Image Models** | 3 | DALL-E 3, Nano Banana, Flux |
| **Use Cases** | 5 | Images, Real-time, Second Opinion, Cost, Overflow |

---

## The Numbers

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| Setup time | **60 seconds** (vs 30+ min with API keys) |
| API keys needed | **0** (vs 5 with traditional setup) |
| Cost per GPT-4 call | **$0.001** |
| Calls per $1 | **1,000** (GPT-5) / **10,000** (DeepSeek) |

---

## How It Works

```
1. pip install blockrun-llm
2. First use → Wallet auto-created at ~/.blockrun/
3. Get QR code for easy funding:
   python -c "from blockrun_llm import open_wallet_qr, get_wallet_address; open_wallet_qr(get_wallet_address())"
4. Scan QR with MetaMask, send $1-5 USDC on Base
5. Your agent calls any model, pays per request
6. Your private key never leaves your machine
```

### What $1 USDC Gets You

| Model | Calls per $1 |
|-------|--------------|
| GPT-5 | ~1,000 |
| DeepSeek | ~10,000 |
| Grok | ~500 |
| DALL-E images | ~20 |

**$1 is enough for weeks of normal use.**

## Use Cases

### Image Generation
Your agent can't generate images natively. BlockRun routes to DALL-E.
```
"blockrun generate a logo for my startup"
```

### Real-Time X/Twitter Data
Your agent's knowledge has a cutoff. Grok has live X access.
```
"blockrun what's trending on X about AI agents?"
```

### AI Reviewing AI
Different models catch different bugs.
```
"blockrun GPT review this code for bugs"
```

### Cost Optimization
DeepSeek is 10-50x cheaper for simple tasks.
```
"blockrun deepseek summarize these 500 files"
```

## A Note from the Builder

I built BlockRun because I got tired of juggling API keys.

Five accounts. Five billing dashboards. Five sets of credentials to rotate. For what? To use AI models that should just work together.

So I made them work together. One wallet. All models. No keys.

If this helps you build something cool, I'd love to hear about it.
